I was hired as a Frontend for ModularCloud, which makes [Open Source](https://github.com/modularcloud/) devtools for developpers who work with blockchains, the main product I worked on is a [block explorer](https://explorer.modular.cloud)
which allows users to inspect the data stored in the blockchains of their choices.

With the help of a designer I worked on the redesign of the website from the [old one](https://nautscan.com) to the [new one](https://explorer.modular.cloud), I helped implement features in it and also started working on the Electron application for the explorer. 

You can find my [contributions](https://github.com/modularcloud/explorer/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AFredkiss3+) on the github repository.
