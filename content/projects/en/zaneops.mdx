I am working on Zaneops, a self-hosted platform as a service for deploying and managing apps, inspired by projects like [vercel](https://vercel.com) and [coolify](https://coolify.io).
This project allow developpers who wish to deploy their apps on their own servers to not manage the CI/CD and configuration of their apps manually.
It supports multiple features such as :

- Deploying services from docker images as well from github repositories
- Preview deploying i.e  ephemeral environment created for each Pull Requests that would be spin up on demand and brought down after a certain time of inactivity
- Deploying CRONs i.e scheduled tasks
- Deploying Workers i.e one-off tasks that are removed post-execution

The project was made using Python and Django for the backend, [tested thoroughly](https://github.com/zane-ops/zane-ops/tree/main/backend/zane_api/tests) using integrations and unit tests where it mattered,
with a documented openapi schema that is used to generate a typescript sdk and used by the frontend to make api requests, the frontend was made using vite/react.

This project is open source and was made in collaboration with [Mohamed CHERIF](https://github.com/mo-cherif) who works on the frontend while I work on the backend.
