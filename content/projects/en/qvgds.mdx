The streamer [silvereledev](https://twitch.tv/silvereledev) organised a charity event in December 2022 bringing together several streamers in the programming sphere of twitch for a 48H live-streaming marathon,
called the [dev-event](https://ledevevent.com/), a nod to the [zevent](https://zevent.fr/) organised by twitch streamer Zerator.
As part of this event, I participated in an open-source project to run the event: **"WHO WANTS TO WIN SHITCOINS?"** a nod to the tv game _Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ?_ but whose reward is a virtual currency called _shitcoin ðŸ’©_ ðŸ˜„.

I participated to the integration of the components in the [figma mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/YyZGzqxlUEDDQTbk0OKvbb/QVGDS?node-id=1-9&t=Fclj4K1rd5MCdILa-0), in VueJS.
This was my first [open source contribution](https://github.com/d34fmute/qvgds/pulls?q=+is%3Apr+author%3AFredkiss3+) and to see the project being used live for a noble cause is a pride of mine ðŸ˜Š.

This project was fully realized live on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/fredkisss).
