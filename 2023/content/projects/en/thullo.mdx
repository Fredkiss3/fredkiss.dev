Thullo is a clone of [Trello](https://trello.com), a project management application with a Kanban board.
It allows you to create projects ("boards"), define tasks ("cards") and organize them in a list,
invite members and assign them tasks, change their status (e.g. to do, in progress, completed) and add labels to these tasks.

This project was realized as a challenge taken from the site [devchallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wP0LbGgEeKhpFHUpPpDh) in 5 months,
live on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/fredkisss) by following the principle of the [Domain Driven Design (DDD)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Domain-driven_design) for the API
and fully tested with [Test Driven Development (TDD)](https://github.com/Fredkiss3/thullo/tree/develop/packages/domain/tests).
