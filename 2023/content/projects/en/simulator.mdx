[Monemprunt.com](https://www.monemprunt.com) is a real estate brokerage platform that provides administrative support to customers
in the context of their real estate loan application.

In this process, monemprunt offers online simulators allowing users to estimate the monthly payments
and the various additional costs of their real estate loan according to the information they fill.

I worked on the development of these simulators by starting on a [design system](https://mec-design-system.netlify.app/) used on all the marketing sites of monemprunt. The project was developed in 2 months and had to be integrated into the main site of monemprunt which is a monorepo.
You can visit the link and test.
