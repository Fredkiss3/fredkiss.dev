As a trainee at monemprunt, I worked on several projects such as :

- The integration of the website [pro.monemprunt.com](https://pro.monemprunt.com) a site designed to present the services of monemprunt to its partners.
  This site was presented at the [RENT](https://www.rent.immo/salon-rent/) a real estate exhibition, on October 20th & 21st of 2021.

- The development of the new [simulators of monemprunt](https://www.monemprunt.com/simulation-emprunt-immobilier/calcul-mensualites-credit-immobilier/)
  for its customers to enable them to estimate the monthly payments of their real estate loan.

- The development of the monemprunt simulators as [widgets](https://wai-mec-demo.netlify.app/)
  for partners to integrate in their website so that they can give their customers access to the monthly payments of their real estate loan.

- The redesign of the white label sites of monemprunt in partnership with several companies including [lamotte](https://lamotte-financement.fr/) and [procivis](procivis-credit.fr/).

- Setting up S.E.A. [landing pages](https://www.monemprunt.com/landing/pourquoi-un-courtier-en-ligne/) for their google & facebook ad campaign.

I also had to work on the configuration of a **Google Cloud Platform** load balancer of monemprunt
in order to integrate and deploy all the services of monemprunt
with **Google Cloud Run** for APIS and **Cloud Storage** for the frontend,
with the objective of migrating all their old services from a virtual machine to a totally cloud-based environment.
