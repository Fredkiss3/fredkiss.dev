The streamer [silvereledev](https://twitch.tv/silvereledev) organised a charity event in December 2022 bringing together several streamers in the programming sphere of twitch for a 48H live-streaming marathon,
called the dev-event, a nod to the [zevent](https://zevent.fr/) organised by twitch streamer Zerator.
As part of this event, I participated in an open-source project to run the event: **"Who wants to win sh*tcoins?"** a nod to the tv game _Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ?_ but whose reward is a virtual currency called _sh*tcoin ðŸ’©_ ðŸ˜„.
