Thullo is a clone of [Trello](https://trello.com), a project management application with a Kanban board.
It allows you to create projects ("boards"), define tasks ("cards") and organize them in a list,
invite members and assign them tasks, change their status (e.g. to do, in progress, completed) and add labels to these tasks.
