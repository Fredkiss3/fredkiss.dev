ZaneOps is an open-source, self-hosted Platform as a Service (PaaS) for deploying and managing applications, inspired by projects like [Railway](https://railway.app), [Vercel](https://vercel.com), and [Coolify](https://coolify.io). This platform allows developers to deploy apps on their own servers without manually managing CI/CD and configuration.
