I was approached by [Richard Poelderl](https://twitter.com/richardpoelderl) to work on Procurato, a Next.js app designed to provide a better UI for querying the German company database [handelsregister.de](https://www.handelsregister.de/) and retrieving information such as titles, capital, and registration documents. My responsibilities included:

- Migrating the app's data-fetching process to [Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/), a background job service, to improve performance, as the app previously fetched documents directly on request, leading to slow response times.
- Implementing new features to query and download historical documents, including the list of shareholders and documents related to various fundraising stages.
