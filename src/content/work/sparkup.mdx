I was engaged as a **freelance** professional by **Sparkup**, a cutting-edge streaming solution designed for large-scale events. Sparkup offers live streaming and digital interactive experiences for conferences, concerts, and corporate events, along with expert support for organizing digital events. Their portfolio includes internal events for high-profile clients such as **Decathlon**, **Nestlé**, and **L'Oreal**. A notable project was [The Great Dictation for the Climate](https://www.youtube.com/live/FnTP7LSKQRM?si=k2BrpdUS_9f7ZJAA&t=1029), which was broadcast to over 10,000 viewers. For this event, Sparkup managed video streaming, an emoji reaction wall, a webcam wall showcasing all connected participants, and integrated real-time comments.

**Key responsibilities included:**

- Migrating the infrastructure from [AWS ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html) to [Scaleway bare metal servers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/bare-metal/) to optimize server costs.
- Implementing an on-demand provisioning and decommissioning system for servers during live sessions using [temporal.io](https://temporal.io) and [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/), tailored to the new Scaleway setup.
- Conducting stress tests with [Grafana/k6](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/) to ensure the new servers could efficiently scale with fluctuating traffic.
- Transitioning an existing custom Python WebSocket server to a more scalable solution using [Centrifugo](https://centrifugal.dev/).
