I joined Modular Cloud as a full-stack developer in September 2023, initially as a contractor, and became full-time in November. ModularCloud builds open-source tools for blockchain developers, and I primarily worked on a [block explorer](https://explorer.modular.cloud) for viewing blockchain data. My key responsibilities included:

- Migrating the project from its [old design](https://nautscan.com) to a new design system in collaboration with a designer.
- Implementing an Electron port for a local developer-friendly version of the app.
- Improving the [codebase](https://github.com/modularcloud/explorer) and resolving performance issues as new features were added.
